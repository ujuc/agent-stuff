Implement the following plan:

# Documentation.md Migration Plan

## Context

The user maintains comprehensive development guidelines in a global `~/.claude/` configuration. The `documentation.md` file (located at `~/.claude/guides/documentation.md`) defines documentation standards for code, APIs, and project files.

The `agent-stuff` repository needs this documentation guide to establish standards for:
- Code comments and inline documentation
- API documentation requirements
- Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
- Project documentation files
- Markdown formatting standards
- Change management and versioning

**Goal**: Migrate the global `documentation.md` into the `agent-stuff` project under `docs/guides/documentation.md`, transforming its format to comply with the project's documentation specifications.

**Why this change is needed**:
- Establish documentation standards within the project context
- Follow the project's YAML front matter specification
- Ensure consistency with other guide documents (like system-rules.md)
- Make documentation guidelines accessible to all project contributors
- Provide a second reference implementation for guide document migrations

**User Decisions** (confirmed):
1. **File location**: `docs/guides/documentation.md` (following spec-design/writing-guide.md)
2. **YAML spec**: Use agent-stuff project spec (common-template.md + writing-guide.md)
3. **Responsibility block**: Convert `<your_responsibility>` to `## Responsibilities` section
4. **Section ordering**: Move "Documentation Reviews" and "Migration Guides" before "See Also"
5. **See Also position**: Always place at the very end of the document

## Implementation Approach

### Overview

Transform the global `~/.claude/guides/documentation.md` (165 lines) from XML metadata format to YAML front matter format following `spec-design/common-template.md` and `spec-design/writing-guide.md` specifications.

### Step 1: Create docs/guides/documentation.md

**Transform the document structure:**

#### 1.1 Convert XML Metadata to YAML Front Matter

**Source XML** (lines 3-22 of global documentation.md):
```xml
<meta>
Document: documentation.md
Role: Documentation Guide
Priority: Medium
Applies To: All code documentation and comments
Optimized For: Claude 4.5 (Sonnet/Opus)
Last Updated: 2025-12-21
</meta>

<context>
This document defines documentation standards for code, APIs, and project files. Good documentation helps others understand and maintain the codebase.
</context>

<your_responsibility>
As Documentation Guide, you must:
- **Document the why**: Explain reasoning, not just what the code does
- **Keep docs current**: Update documentation with code changes
- **Use examples**: Include practical, working examples
- **Follow standards**: Apply consistent formatting and structure
</your_responsibility>
```

**Target YAML Front Matter:**
```yaml
---
name: Documentation Standards
description: 코드, API, 프로젝트 문서화 표준 - 효과적인 문서 작성 가이드라인
version: 2026.02.0
tags: documentation, code-comments, api-docs, markdown, standards, adr
context: |
  This document defines documentation standards for code, APIs, and project files.
  Good documentation helps others understand and maintain the codebase.

  Covers: code comments, API documentation, Architecture Decision Records (ADR),
  project documentation files, markdown formatting, and change management.
metadata:
  author: ujuc
  status: active
  role: Documentation Guide - Standards for code and project documentation
  priority: medium
  applies-to: agent
  optimized-for: Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.6
---
```

**Key transformations:**
- `<meta>` block → YAML `metadata` section
- `<context>` → YAML `context` field (expanded with coverage summary)
- `<your_responsibility>` → Will become `## Responsibilities` section (not in front matter)
- Add Korean `description` (within 200 char limit)
- Set CalVer `version: 2026.02.0` (February 2026 migration, patch 0)
- Generate relevant `tags` based on document content

#### 1.2 Add Responsibilities Section

Following `spec-design/writing-guide.md`, add after the title:

```markdown
# Documentation Standards

## Responsibilities

- **Document the why**: Explain reasoning, not just what the code does
- **Keep docs current**: Update documentation with code changes
- **Use examples**: Include practical, working examples
- **Follow standards**: Apply consistent formatting and structure
```

#### 1.3 Preserve All Content Sections

**Keep all existing sections** in the following order:

1. **Documentation Principles** (lines 24-30)
2. **Code Comments** (lines 32-46)
   - When to Comment
   - Comment Guidelines
3. **API Documentation** (lines 48-63)
   - Essential Elements
   - Best Practices
4. **Architecture Decision Records (ADR)** (lines 65-80)
   - ADR Structure
   - When to Write ADRs
5. **Project Documentation Files** (lines 82-100)
   - Essential Files
   - Architecture Documentation
   - Development Documentation
6. **Markdown Formatting Standards** (lines 102-135)
   - Document Structure
   - Code Blocks
   - Formatting Guidelines
7. **Change Management** (lines 137-144)
   - Version Documentation
8. **Documentation Reviews** (lines 153-158) - **MOVE BEFORE See Also**
9. **Migration Guides** (lines 160-165) - **MOVE BEFORE See Also**
10. **See Also** (lines 146-151) - **MOVE TO END**

#### 1.4 Reorganize Sections

**Current problematic order** (lines 146-165):
```markdown
## See Also

- [**CLAUDE.md**](../CLAUDE.md) - Primary document with complete guidelines
- [System Rules](../system-rules.md) - Critical system-wide rules
- [Technical Standards](../technical-standards.md) - Code quality and standards
- [Version Control](../version-control.md) - Git workflow and commit messages

### Documentation Reviews
- Review docs with code changes
- Check for accuracy and completeness
- Verify examples still work
- Update version numbers and dates
- Remove outdated information

### Migration Guides
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Provide step-by-step migration instructions
- Include before/after examples
- Estimate migration effort
- Offer automation scripts when possible
```

**Target reorganization:**

1. Move "Documentation Reviews" and "Migration Guides" as subsections under "Change Management"
2. Place "See Also" at the very end

**New structure:**
```markdown
## Change Management

### Version Documentation
- Maintain CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
- Group changes by type: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- Include release date and version number
- Link to relevant issues/PRs

### Documentation Reviews
- Review docs with code changes
- Check for accuracy and completeness
- Verify examples still work
- Update version numbers and dates
- Remove outdated information

### Migration Guides
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Provide step-by-step migration instructions
- Include before/after examples
- Estimate migration effort
- Offer automation scripts when possible

## See Also

- [**CLAUDE.md**](../../CLAUDE.md) - Primary document with complete guidelines
- [System Rules](../system-rules.md) - Critical system-wide rules
- [Technical Standards](../technical-standards.md) - Code quality and standards
- [Version Control](../version-control.md) - Git workflow and commit messages
```

**Note**: Update relative paths in "See Also" links:
- `../CLAUDE.md` → `../../CLAUDE.md` (docs/guides/ is two levels deep)
- `../system-rules.md` → `../system-rules.md` (system-rules.md is in docs/)
- Other guide references remain as-is (will be commented out if they don't exist)

#### 1.5 Handle Guide Document References

In "See Also" section, only keep references to existing or soon-to-exist documents:

**Active references:**
- `[**CLAUDE.md**](../../CLAUDE.md)` - exists in project root
- `[System Rules](../system-rules.md)` - exists in docs/

**Comment out non-existent references:**
```markdown
<!-- The following guide documents are referenced from the global ~/.claude/
     configuration and may be migrated to this project in the future:

- [Technical Standards](../technical-standards.md) - Code quality and standards
- [Version Control](../version-control.md) - Git workflow and commit messages
-->
```

### Step 2: Update Project CLAUDE.md (Optional)

**Decision point**: Should we add a reference to documentation.md in CLAUDE.md?

Current CLAUDE.md structure (53 lines):
- Project Overview
- Directory Structure
- Documentation Guidelines
  - Required YAML Front Matter
  - Core System Rules (references system-rules.md)
- Maintenance Rules

**Recommendation**: Add a brief reference to documentation.md under the "Documentation Guidelines" section:

```markdown
### Documentation Standards

For detailed guidelines on code comments, API documentation, and project documentation files, see [docs/guides/documentation.md](./docs/guides/documentation.md).
```

**Line count check**:
- Current CLAUDE.md: 53 lines
- Addition: ~3 lines
- New total: ~56 lines (well under 300 line limit)

### Step 3: Verification

**Document format validation:**
1. YAML front matter syntax is valid (no parsing errors)
2. All required fields present: name, description, version, tags, context, metadata
3. Description in Korean, max 200 chars
4. Version follows CalVer: `2026.02.0`
5. Metadata includes: author, status, role, priority, applies-to, optimized-for

**Content integrity validation:**
1. All 10 main sections preserved
2. "Responsibilities" section added after title
3. "Documentation Reviews" and "Migration Guides" moved under "Change Management"
4. "See Also" section at the very end
5. Relative paths corrected for docs/guides/ location

**Cross-reference validation:**
1. Verify that referenced files exist or are commented out
2. Check relative paths are correct
3. CLAUDE.md reference added (if Step 2 implemented)
4. CLAUDE.md line count remains under 300

**Test the documentation:**
1. Read the new docs/guides/documentation.md to verify it's well-formed
2. Verify YAML front matter can be parsed correctly
3. Confirm section ordering is logical
4. Check that Korean description displays correctly

## Critical Files

**Files to create:**
- `/Users/ujuc/repos/agent-stuff/docs/guides/documentation.md` - New document (estimated ~170 lines with reorganization)

**Files to modify (optional):**
- `/Users/ujuc/repos/agent-stuff/CLAUDE.md` - Add documentation.md reference (~3 lines added)

**Source files (read-only):**
- `/Users/ujuc/.claude/guides/documentation.md` - Source content (165 lines)
- `/Users/ujuc/repos/agent-stuff/spec-design/common-template.md` - YAML front matter specification
- `/Users/ujuc/repos/agent-stuff/spec-design/writing-guide.md` - Guide document format specification

**Directories:**
- `/Users/ujuc/repos/agent-stuff/docs/guides/` - Target directory (currently empty)

## Expected Outcomes

After implementation:

1. **docs/guides/documentation.md exists** as a guide document following project specs
2. **YAML front matter compliance** - All required fields present, Korean description, CalVer version
3. **Content preservation** - All sections preserved with proper organization
4. **Responsibilities section added** - Converted from `<your_responsibility>` XML block
5. **Logical section ordering** - "See Also" at the very end, subsections properly grouped
6. **Correct relative paths** - All cross-references updated for docs/guides/ location
7. **CLAUDE.md integration** (optional) - Project documentation properly references documentation.md

This establishes documentation.md as a core guide document and provides a second reference implementation for guide migrations, demonstrating how to:
- Handle section reorganization
- Convert XML responsibility blocks to markdown sections
- Manage relative path updates for nested directories
- Apply project-specific YAML front matter specifications

# Important Guidelines

<meta>
Document: guidelines.md
Role: Practice Guide
Priority: Medium
Applies To: All development interactions
Optimized For: Claude 4.5 (Sonnet/Opus)
Last Updated: 2025-12-21
</meta>

<context>
This document provides important guidelines to follow when using Claude Code.
It defines best practices and default behaviors for daily development work.
</context>

<your_responsibility>
As Practice Guide, you must:
- **Follow conventions**: Adhere to documented rules and practices
- **Be proactive**: Infer useful actions when uncertain
- **Maintain quality**: Maintain code quality and consistency
</your_responsibility>

## Maintenance Rules

- **Document unclear code**
  Add comments to explain ambiguous code or names.
- **Confirm model changes**
  Get user confirmation before changing LLM model versions.
- **Use modern syntax**
  Use the latest stable language syntax.

## Default Behaviors

<default_to_action>
When user intent is unclear, infer and proceed with the most useful action:

**Core principles:**
- "Suggest" might mean implement - consider context
- Use tools to gather missing information directly
- Default to implementation over suggestions

**Always require explicit approval for:**
- Destructive operations (DELETE, DROP, bulk deletions)
- Large-scale refactoring
- API changes or breaking changes
- Production environment operations
</default_to_action>

## Things to Avoid

- Bypassing commit hooks with `--no-verify`
- Disabling tests instead of fixing them
- Committing code that doesn't compile
- Making assumptions without checking existing code
- Storing secrets in code
- Ignoring security warnings
- Skipping code reviews
- Using deprecated APIs without justification

## Things to Always Do

- Commit working code incrementally
- Update plan documents as you progress
- Learn from existing implementations
- Reassess after 3 failed attempts
- Consider security implications
- Consider edge cases
- Document non-obvious decisions
- Keep user experience in mind

## Emergency Procedures

### When Things Break

1. Don't panic
2. Check recent changes
3. Review error logs
4. Isolate the problem
5. Create minimal reproduction
6. Document findings
7. Implement fix with tests
8. Post-mortem for learning

### Getting Help

- After 3 attempts, ask for guidance
- Provide context and what you've tried
- Share error messages and logs
- Explain your understanding of the problem
- Be open to different approaches
